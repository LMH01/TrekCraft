#Trek Craft

Trek Craft is a mod that aims to implemet blocks and items that are Star Trek themed. The base for this mod is the "A Touch of Trek" resource pack created by Cygnus656. He gave me permission to use his content for this mod.

**Trek Craft requires LMH01_lib to work!**

If you want to compile your own version of Trek Craft you will need to edit your build path inside your IDE to implement LMH01_lib as dependency.
